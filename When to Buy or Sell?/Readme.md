# Fintech: When to Buy and Sell?
* Suppose we only has a single stock to buy or sell. Since all the price information is known in advance, we can use a simple strategy to do trading:
1. Buy if the price is up for 3 consecutive future days.
2. Sell if the price is down for 3 consecutive future days.
